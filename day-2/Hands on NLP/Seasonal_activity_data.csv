"Don't Buy!: Beware. . .I have washed and greased the brand new cookie sheet five (5) times or more, and black still keeps appearing on paper towel that rubbed Crisco on pan. This is a chemical that is in the cookie sheet that I suspect couldn't be safe. T FAL will not refund you your money back. When asked, they said it was made in China, of course. They say they are no longer making cookie sheets. My 15-20 yr old Wearever Airbake was made in Wisconsin, and it was great. :-(",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Can't recommend: I have two of these (received as gifts) and they remain in the cupboard. Found them very difficult to use. They always curl up and slide, even when moistened on the back with water, and I finally had to resort to taping them down. Also needed tons more flour to keep things from sticking. Using a countertop was much easier despite the clean-up problem. If this product causes so much extra trouble, why buy it? I recently had the idea of taping them to my crafting table to make an easily cleaned work surface. At least they wouldn't be taking up space in my kitchen!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Do not buy unless you will connect it though the audio output: I recently purchased the car kit (as the Stiletto does not have an FM transmitter). The FM transmitter works, but not well. The signal it emits is not strong at all, and as a result, you can barely hear Siruis from my car stereo (irrespective of what channel you select). The problem is not acquiring the signal from the satellite to the Stiletto (that is very good); the problem is the car kit emitting the single to the car stereo. I assume, but have not yet tried, that connecting the car kit via the audio output will solve this problem, but if you intend to use the car kit without an audio output line, DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. It will result in nothing more than frustration.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Not one bit funny!: I really don't get how this movie even has 3 stars because it was one of the worst movies I've seen. I kept skipping forward hoping it would get better but I couldn't even finish watching it. I like most of the actors but their roles were just stinky and Aniston just continues to churn out more of her.... whatever it is that she churns out and it is definitely not good. At least I only wasted 99 cents but I feel bad for people who actually went to the theater for this.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"An homage to a great poet, and my mother, Corabelle Hardy Rodgers, who recited his poetry for me.: From the time that I was a little girl, I have been exposed to the beautiful work of this gifted poet, and I was pleased to find a full and complete copy of his work, not just the poetry that was written in the dialect of the African living in America, but also his sonnets -- which are every bit as beautiful and important as those of William Shakespeare. I rated the book on the basis of its content, which is complete. The presentation does not do justice to the work inside, thus a four-star rating.

"Crazy: This dude is one crazy [fellow], I tell you.

Although I really believe that half of what he says is just for the controversy (and controversy sells), eminem is a tight mc who can do things on many different styles. The CD lacked a bit of variety in content and the beats could have been better in some songs (but they kicked ass in other tracks like Stan) but the fact that eminem has such an amazing ability to put lyrics together (and in a way a bit different from other rappers), he definently deserves five stars.

Another Death in the Industrial Era. R.I.P. S.P.: This was a real shocker when i got the cd about three weeks ago thank to a online buddy. But I really tried to give the album a chance only daddyuwarbash whatever song that was decent but the rest sorry. They had almost 10 years to write stuff and it comes down to this. A Shame. But with this album I say this should be the final straw and hang up the synths and Vocador and call it the final nail in the coffin. The songs were too over here and over there it was not like the dark elements and the dark vocals and harsh lyrics just a sold out industrial band. Thank You SYNTHSPOP for making this all possible.

"some good, some bad: This book has some very good advice about knowing when to speak up and knowing when to be silent when your daughter is expressing herself. It is also frought with some very bad advice about allowing ""experimentation"" in your daughters life.I was confused about how one section deals with teaching girls that their self worth is not tied up in their bodies, then giving dads the advice to allow a daughter to wear provocative clothing. I quote, ""wearing sexy clothing is a normal adolescent behavior"". Some daughters might be all the better for allowing boys to ogle them, but mine better keep the receipt.I say no thank you to most of the advice given in this book.

The second started sending random keystrokes to the computer after about a month. (It is interesting to watch your e-mail client decided it needs to create an infinite number of new messages.)

If it doesn't prove more reliable, I'll look elsewhere for ergonomic keyboards.I give this keyboard five stars for features and comfort and one star for reliability.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Boring and repetitive, 'supported' by pseudo-scientist irrelevant research on animals which I found distressing.: I am currently training to be an Infant Massage instructor and this is a recommended book.However, considering the title '..Human Significance of the Skin..', the author has relied to an excessive extent on animal research to support his views, which greatly undermines the book. The first 67 pages consist of deprivation and isolation-type experiments on animals and their offspring.

"The conservative mind: overrated and dull: Every true conservative knows the Conservative mind. It had a enormous impact in 1953 and is still very respected. In my opinion it's overrated. The book is dull; Kirks style is uninviting. He keeps repeating the same slogans over and over again: religion is the basis of all society, there must be order and the left is demolishing the world. I advise you just to read the introduction with its famous canon of conservative tought. That will do. Kirk is only interested in explaining his own philosophy and that's why every conservative seems the same in this book. Take for example Edmund Burke.

"(1.5) History Lite: Perhaps this ""one afternoon book"" contains all there really is to know of Marie Antoinette's short reign at the side of Louis XVI of France before the French Revolution occasioned the loss of her head. Indeed, the book cover suggests some revelations about Mirabeau, DuBarry, and Robespierre. Unfortunately, they are only mentioned in passing among the rambling, if poetic, musings of Marie Antoniette. As simple as a diary, truth is a matter of perception, so the truth can't be faulted with historical inaccuracy. It can, however, be faulted for lack of substance.

"Better than we expected!: I first bought this just to take on a trip since it wouldn't take up as much space as our little girl's plastic tub. We loved using it so much that we haven't used anything else since! It is very comfortable on her little back, and I don't have to worry about her sliding off to the side like in her old tub. It comes with a nice little hanger which makes it easy to hang up and dry.The only reason I give it 4 stars is that she keeps sliding down on it and we have to scoot her back up. The size also does not fit in sinks well, so we end up leaning over the tub which can be a pain.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The first few pages contained a number of apolitical examples of hypocrisy, which gave me the impression that it would be a fair, academic analysis of how smart people end up subscribing to dumb ideas.It wasn't until I purchased the book and made it a little further in, that I realized it is not. This book is very politicized, and makes little effort to discuss the subject in an unbiased manner. I'm ashamed to say that I didn't realize where the author was going until his rant on W. E. DuBois, followed by his suggestion that atheists believe what they do because they're simply too arrogant to believe in anything more important than themselves. Of course this is absolutely absurd and int",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
DON'T BUY THIS....: I bought this DVD in the hopes that there would be some nudity. The NOT RATED sign on the cover fooled me into thinking it would be somewhat explicit.

Hence, they write dialogue-heavy, overbearing and certainly unrealistic ""religiousy"" dialogue, as though that were all that's needed to resolve every crisis, however dramatically interesting.

"Poor support: Don't try getting repair parts from Swisher. You can't get most of them. They don't sell through other distributors so you can't get them from there either. The cheezy little staples that hold the line on mine broke. After welding them a few times, I tried to buy a new disk. Nope. Can't. It's a simple device. Motor, belt, disk and a couple wheels. Works OK for what it is, discounting the cheap B&S; engine that's designed to last one season and be unrepairable at any reasonable cost.I got it to do heavy brush around a fence line. Works for that. It isn't a mower. No easy height control. Too heavy and unwieldy for general whacking. Lines break frequently at the staples rather than wearing out. Bad design.

"Coffee cool within 20 minutes: We purchased this 6 weeks ago. Our coffee must be microwaved if brewed 20 minutes before drinking. They recommend warming carafe with hot water before brewing. However, if you use the carafe to pour in cool water for brewing you then need to fill the carafe with hot water and let it sit 10 minutes or so to heat carafe, pour out water and then start brewing - no thank you! Also that doesn't work at all if you want to delay brew. I called customer service and they said to try removing carafe from coffee maker after brewing. Apparently, if it sits on the plate ( which doesn't get warm) the top stays open allowing your coffee to cool. This is not mentioned in the instruction book.

Works great on bare floor as well as carpet. It got a LOT of dirt from my clean looking carpet. The equipment comes with a free replacement HEPA filter too - in case your first one wears out too soon.The only complain I have for the vacuum is that the dust container is not easy to clean. Its plastic, and so you can not clean it too easily - if you clean it with a wet sponge, you have to wait for it to dry before you use the equipment again, since paper towels do not usually do a good job on such plastics.Assembling was very very easy.

"Save your pennies for a better mixer: My wife bought me this mixer as a Christmas present. It was to be an upgrade from my trusty old 4.5 quart KitchenAid mixer I've had for almost twenty years. This new one doesn't deserve to wear the KitchenAid name.On the weekends I bake bread and bagels. Old trusty can plow through 5 or 6 batches of bagel dough without a problem. The new ""pro"" model can't even make it through two before switching off from overheating. Also it gives off an odor half way through the first batch. The recipe I use is from an old issue of Cook Illustrated, in the article they state they use a KitchenAid mixer. Also the recipe uses a mere 4 cups of flour.If you really want one of these I'm considering leaving mine at the end of the driveway",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"I wanted to like it...: ... but it just isn't very good. Rowland's self-indulgent singing style is too grating for their strong horn section to cover up. He's all over the friggin' map. The song writing is mostly forgettable. I have to say I can't understand why a few people love this album so much. It's such a far cry from the band's inspirations (per the liner notes) - the 1960's soul greats in America. I actually like their/his next album, Too Rye Aye, but this was disappointing. If you want UK soul go for Van Morrison.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Easier to get in and out of the ear, more comfortable to wear, and crisper highs with lots of bass. The wires are also very thin and too long on the 6i's.

It just simply made me realize what his mind is all about.

It is better than what came with my Palm M130 and now that I have replaced the battery it works great. Just FYI if you are replacing your Palm battery make sure you back-up everything because when I did I lost all the programs I had on it. The only programs which stayed were the ones preloaded the way it was purchased. Other than that the product is fantastic.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"A cheerfully-bawdy romantic time-travel fantasy: 4.6 stars: This is a cheerfully-bawdy romantic time-travel fantasy, set in 19th-century Copenhagen and 21st-century London. The time-travel device (in both senses) is cartoonish (but fun). Jensen writes well and has done her homework. The protagonist is a hooker with a heart of gold (OK, gilt), which shows once again that a good writer can recycle the hoariest cliche into Good Stuff. Fluff, but *good* fluff.Happy reading,Peter D.

"Good Second Book as it isn't really a smiple book to learn from scratch: If you have already finished reading a good introductory beginners book (I like: Learn Chess: A complete Course for example for an adult or teenage reader) and are ready to move on, then Polgar's ""A World Champions Guilde to Chess: Step-by-step..."" makes for a good book.

One should always praise a film that dares to raise thought-provoking questions, yet in this case I can`t help but give it one star. Despite the gripping premise, this movie is too long, unfocused, slow and disjointed to deserve a higher rating. Director Wim Wenders has an interesting concept, still he seems uncomfortable with the material here and the result is a failed attempt. The plot is contrived at best, the characters` motivations and attitudes don`t make much sense and the story truly is a test to one`s patiente and good-will.

Bronson plays Rancher Ben Justin that is just trying to make a living starting up a cattle ranch; the main problem he faces in this one, believe it or not, is himself. He is mad at everyone it seems until he finds out that not being the richest man in town isn't everything. Of course there are some bad guys over at a neighboring ranch, but they play into a minor secondary story that correlates with the main one with Ben Justin and his family. Overall, I'd say this movie leaves you with a better understanding of life and leaves you with a good moral message.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

First off, the magic section makes very little sense with regards to the drain and mana system, and the aspected magician isn't explained at all. Secondly, the Matrix uses overcomplicated rules for even simple tasks. The technical jargon used was quite confusing.

The first time I tried it I found it on the shelf of a discount store that buys end of the season items. When I returned for more, there was none to be had. I was relieved to find it on Amazon.

The novel was dull and boring. There was no excitement or suspense. There wasn't even a interesting plot. The novel also had an extreme amount of unnecessary characters,and it was too long which made the novel even more ridiculous. From most novels, you learn some values or something, but I didn't learn anything from Arrowsmith, except that sometimes a nap can be more interesting than reading a book.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Almost every song on this CD is different and begins with a random modern art type song that seems fragmented, but integrates beautifully and keeps your interest. The second song is the one that sounds like Tears for Fears. It is so well done you'll want to play it over and over. This is not experimental music; it is art",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

To view the storyline as a case of ""society's...reverence of appearance above all else"" and to equate Cheryl's conduct with ""humilia[ion] by forced exercise or dieting"" is a major case of the reader projecting HER issues on Murphy!

"Beautiful But Disappointing: While the Little Women film was wonderful, the accompanying soundtrack was disappointing. The tracks appear in random order with no rhyme or reason. Logic suggests it would have been appropriate to play them in sequence. However, each song included is lovely. The main title, Orchard House, is frostily beautiful and lyrical. It calls to mind the simplicity and serenity of a New England winter. Valley of the Shadow, while breathtakingly solemn, plays for just over two minutes, which is far too short. Several other tracks: Scarlet Fever, Two Couples, Burdens, Harvest Time, Amy Abroad, and The Laurence Boy, give the listener much too little. Each lasts only 90 seconds or less.

The cast is a riot namely the three witches perfectly played by Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Kathy Najimy. The plot revolves around these three witches coming back to life 300 years after being hanged. they then set off to take the lives of every child in Salem so they can live forever. As ludicrous as the plot seems, the three bumbling, wise-cracking and sometimes pitifully stupid witches are so fun on screen, that the plot isn't even really anything to focus on.

"Forster's best.: This book is a book that is deeper than it first appears. It deals with the tension between the British and the native Indians of India, as well as with the tension between the Hindus and the Muslims. It also deals with the mystical in its portrayal of characters in search of the infinite and eternal. The book is divided into three sections which correspond with the seasons of the Indian year - the Cold Weather, the Hot Weather and the Rains. Each section of the book is dominated by each of the seasons. Each section also focuses on one of the three ethnic groups found in India during this time (1920's). They are Muslim, Anglo-Indian and Hindu. This is a very deep book, that has to be read at least a couple of times in order for the reader",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Not a big fan: I didn't think it was that great. Atwood is a good writer, and there are some beautifully written passages in the book. Overall it was hard for me to get through. Mostly, the lack of logic in the plot annoyed me. And I got really sick of the narrator character. Basically the whole book takes place inside her imagination, which is a place I would rather not be. She didn't seem very smart, and I thought she was a pretty boring and weak person. Also, I'm not a big fan of reading about racey infidelity.Also, I prefer stories about people attempting to fix their problems instead of just whining about them. I know that negative stories can often teach us things. But I don't feel I gained much more than a headache from reading this particular story",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Providing new details about his youth and later years: Howlin Wolf was born in 1910 as a poverty-stricken sharecropper in Mississippi who began his career singing for two decades in juke joints with the first Delta blues stars: James Segrest and Mark Hoffman's Moanin' At Midnight: The Life And Times Of Howlin' Wolf provides a powerful definitive biography of the blues musician which delves into his early years.

Highly recommended for any prior Howlin Wolf fan.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

So many small things to wrong in the movie to keep the certain characters in the plot, it makes the whole thing uncomfortable. It is like a ""Fawlty Towers"" episode on steroids without the laughs. There a few chuckles in the movie, but it just doesn't justify the frenetic pacing. Penelope does the best she can with a strange role. She plays a depressed drunk for most of the movie.

It names nations that promulgate and harbor terrorism (such as Saudi Arabia and Iran) and is willing to bite the bullet where action is required.My sole qualm is that by lack of a philosophical foundation there is a limit to its ideological clarity. Thus it slips into the vogue beliefs of imposing democracy, finding hope for the UN and Islam, and accommodating the foibles of ?Æallies?ô.

This movie will definitely have an audience and a cult following (a small one but large enough to be classified as a cult following) but for most people, it will be horrible. Just take it as a comedy and you might actually enjoy it. Then again....you could make some sort of drinking game out of this movie I bet lol.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

good but kids need supervision: Granpa sent this to my 6yr old from australia even before it arrived in the US market. It seemed a bit of a challenge for a 6yr old but gradually he learned. For a few months he put it away and now that he is almost 7 he enjoys playing with it. It is highly educational without a doubt. We play WORD HUNT with the whole family.The cons of this game is that some of the words on word hunt that we have come across are 'Vagina' and 'Porno' which I am quite certain should not be on a game that is recommended for kids. So adult supervision is a definite must.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"A First-Class Production: ""Brother"" Jack McDuff was one of those jazz guys who seemed to have been around forever--and at 72 when this CD was recorded, he ws still holding his own with the younger guys. On this Concord Jazz recording, McDuff's Hammond organ sets the groove for experienced sidemen such as George Benson on guitar, Red Holloway on tenor sax, and Grady Tate on drums, but there are also contributions from younger musicians such as Mark Whitfield on guitar. On one of the cuts, ""After Hours,"" McDuff switches to piano, but most of the cuts are organ quartet/quintet-type arrangements. There may not be a lot of new musical ground broken here, but the music still sounds fresh and eminently enjoyable. If you like B-3 grooves, you'll like this CD, whic",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Since others here do an excellent job of recounting the novel in detail, I'll just mention a few things:1) Often the most exciting parts of the novel are only ancillary to the main story.2) Bova's climate alarmism is readily apparent and annoying.3) The so-called ""New Morality"" makes no sense (i.e. it has no basis in the reality of what people believe today and where those beliefs seem headed). Bova simply comes across as mildly anti-religious.4) Much of the novel seemed downright dull, plodding - as if Bova was terribly bored with his own creation and simply going through the motions.I really wonder if the sequels are any better, or if they're even worth the effort.

It was a waste of time.It started off well enough, and I initially liked Ms. Binchy's writing style, so I kept going. There were several flaws, however:1. The characters (save Vonni) seemed to be cardboard cutouts. If they were any more one-dimensional, they'd be a dot.2. The end result was too predictable. If about a third of the way through you couldn't figure out exactly where each character was going to end up, you weren't trying.3. The dialogue. Who talks like that?

It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back. This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster.

"Excellent read: This is a easy read, it reinforces a lot of things I already believed in, namely that diet controls a good portion of our health. It takes that concept further than most doctors would, not only preventing the big killers (Heart attack, heart disease, diabetes, etc.) but also the common flu, allergies, and other childhood illnesses. He has a no-holds barred attitude about society's norms and morales, and it's a refreshing but not overly paranoid view of the food world we live in.I'm already a vegan but it gave me some great ideas on some things I should be adding to my children's diet as well as my own.

The 100% pure oil here (you just have to trust them) is, not surprisingly, slightly oily, with a sort of oily, eucalyptus-like scent.

Instead of building any sort of strong narrative, author John Everson chooses to burden readers with Kieran's horny daydreams and creepy thoughts for a girl barely out of high school, or overload us with the graphic details for raunchy roadside sex and a teenaged girl's masturbation fantasies.

Jeremy Keller is lost in his life, clueless enough to be pitied, but not so dumb that we lose interest in the mysterious turns his life has taken. Stein writes briskly and subtly; when the readers begin to accept all the absurdities in ""Lost"" as real life they gain another laugh at themselves.

"Horrible Historical: After completing this work it appears obvious that the author was actually writing an alternate history scenario but lacked the confidence to market his effort without the necessity of positioning it in the guise of a historical novel.Unfortunately, the life of Julius Caesar whether related by anyone from Suetonius to Colleen McCullough is more interesting and complex in fact and fiction than anything that ""Emperor"" approaches.I would suggest that this poorly designed effort will be of more interest to Hollywood for the next lavishly produced, big budget, historically inaccurate feature than anyone seriously interested in gaining some insight into the life and times of one of history's greatest men.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Faulty history: Douglas has two characters living in Rome in the reign of Tiberius: a ""Prince Gaius"" and Caligula, the future emperor. At first I was puzzled as to who this Gaius was, or why Douglas felt the need to introduce such a fictional character - - until I realized that he obviously wasn't aware that they are the same person! Caligula (""little boot"") was Gaius's nickname. My impression is that Douglas read the main ancient sources, Tacitus's ""Annals"" and Suetonius's ""Lives of the Caesars"". Tacitus refers to Caligula as ""Gaius"" throughout, but the the part of his work dealing with his reign is lost. So Douglas apparently did not realize that the ""Gaius"" playing a crucial role in the last years of Tiberius's reign was the same person as the later emp",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Victorian writing that somehow isn't pretentious: I remember a staging of this book when I was young that, like most kids' books turned in to plays, was confusing and kind of scary. I guess as I kid my attention span was so short I didn't even notice what was going on. Rereading this after a few years have passed, I now realize this is a masterpiece of style and characterizations. Unlike most books for kids, it doesn't condescend, and unlike a lot of Victorian style writing (in my opinion anyways), it doesn't have huge pretense. People are bugged by the fact that the animals are highly human, but I think that's part of the point.

The science fiction part of the story is extremely derivative of old Star Trek shows (""phazers"" for ST's phasers, etc.), the plot is threadbare, and the romance is totally unbelieveable. The talkative computer, a plot device used to explain things to the dense heroine, is extremely annoying (why does she keep calling Brittany ""doll""?).

At the time I was around 15 years old and had been reading romances for a couple years (I am now 17). I re-read it and my opinion has changed not at all. The plot is more emotionally involved than the usual story. I fell in love with the characters all over again and I look for that feeling on other books now.

The ""All Along the Watchtower"" that everybody seems to love is travesty to Bob Dylan, Jimi Hendrix, it is the worst cover of that song I have ever heard. The rest of the album takes songs that were good or at least passable and corrupts them. Some bands have great live albums. DMB, at least with this album, sounds worse than I have ever heard them.

"Wonderful author: I loved her books when I was a child in the sixties and I love to think that they have been around for over a hundred years and yet they are still wonderful stories that don't feel at all old-fashioned. The world they are set in is certainly different from ours, which adds to their interest, but the writing is immediate and there is nothing mannered or didactic that one might associate with books from Victorian times. A combination of lively, very real children, with sometimes a little magic thrown in and sometimes just the adventures children have when they're not too closely supervised, the books are fast-paced, humorous and adorably wholesome.This is a story of a family under stress and the children's earnest attempts to put everything",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

So I started reading Barker's Galilee with relish, expecting an intriguing and fascinating tale of mysterious gods and goddesses, etc. But, woh! After some 200 hundred pages, it felt like I was fourteen again, reading my daily Mills & Boon paperback! I mean, the Rachel character was just soooo predictable and how on earth did Galilee decide she must be the one and only after sooo many (women...and men...and children...)? Nope, your standard Barbara Cartland yarn here: from rags to riches lass finds out her handsome John John Kennedy look-alike husband has somehow turned into a monster, but fortunately is",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Poor transfer from analog to digital: The audio on the copy of the CD I purchased is tinny, and distant. While the low end of the instrumentation comes through passably the higher ranges and the vocals distort and break up. It is as if the recording was taken from a pretty well worn out LP. I made better copies of LP's to cassette tapes back in college. While the original performances may have been exceptional this CD does them no justice at all.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Sheer Fun!: What a hoot! I was enchanted! When I brought the dvd home, my husband raised an eyebrow and said ""you're going to make me watch THAT?"" before turning back to his computer... 15 minutes into the movie, I caught him tapping his feet and whistling along under his breath.Some of the sexual innuendo had me a little thoughtful, at first, about showing this to my godchildren -- but it's nothing as bad as they see on TV every day, and certainly not enough to make me decide not to show it to them.Great staging, good choreography, good wardrobe (that had me taking notes, in places, for tribal belly dance costumes). The cast obviously enjoyed themselves tremendously which made the show that much better. This one's a keeper!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Neil Peart, having recently immersed himself into the individualistic ideaology of Ayn Rand, joined with Lee and Lifeson to create an album the three of them could be proud of--2112. Theatrical in its execution, the title track tells a story with music and words matched so well that you can just close your eyes and watch it play in your mind.

I truly appreciated the lack of four letter words that most movies seem to get more than their share of these days.

It produces a pleasant and noticeable amount of moisture in the air. One drawback is the accumulation of mineral deposits.

I took it to Europe for my 5 week honeymoon and cared for it well, on the 4th week of use it literally fell apart in my hands. I sent it in under warranty and they fixed it and sent it back. Not 10 minutes of use later it fell apart again. I did get probably a 1000 pictures out of it before it fell apart but I am finally now going to purchase the 1.4 version of this lens, so I would have been better off just getting that one in the first place. I would say go ahead and spring for the 1.4, the used lens market prices are very high so even if you don't end up using it you can recoup your costs.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Not only is it yellow-peril racism, but it's just silly overall and advances none of Heinlein's philosophical beliefs.

You have go to the the 1962 book ""Farnham's Freehold"" to find a worse Heinlein novel.Two stars only because Heinlein wrote it.

"Stephen King tries to be Jerry Seinfeld, and fails.: I understand the experiment Stephen King had going with this book. ""Is it possible to write a book about nothing?"" The answer, at least in this case, is a resounding NO. Mr. King tried to write a book who's merits stood strictly on the narrative. As he repeatedly said throughout the book, there is no story. ""There is no through-line."" It is a highly unsatisfying book, not because there is no solution to the mystery, but because there was barely any mystery. It was so mundane. At no point did I really care to figure out the mystery. If Mr. King had given me something to sink my teeth into, then maybe I would have been interested and I would have gotten involved.

That cassette got stuck in my player one day and I knew I couldn't go long without replacing it with a CD. Rich Mullins music strikes a chord deep in the heart of the human spirit. He walked the earth with humility, living a no-nonsense, deep, practical faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. Last night I listened to it before bed and every song flowed into the next. My favorites are ""If I Stand"" and ""Step by Step."" I love finding videos of him in concert, just him and his piano. His voice was so earthy and alive.

The shampoo does not lather very much because it doesn't have sulfates (which is just FILLER. Does not clean your hair). Also, if you have hard water, which most people do, it's not going to lather as well. However, I find that in spite of all of that, it lathers well enough. I only use a quarter size amount and I have really thick hair. I love that it's cruelty free. It has a faint smell, which is nice because it allows you to wear lotion or perfume without clashing.

Jackie Chan, as expected, provides some great action sequences but I think a big difference between the second and the first is the added comical role that Jackie Chan plays, and the added action role that Chris Tucker plays (along with his incredibly funny lines, of course).

Last night I was holding one full of red wine. The bowl broke off the stem, sending red wine all over my brand new leather couch.

"Classic Science Fiction: The Illustrated Man is a collection of 18 science fiction short stories by genre master Ray Bradbury circa 1950, loosely tied together as a series of living images viewed on the body of the title character. The stories are mostly cerebral, although you shouldn't expect hard science. Mars and Venus as depicted in these stories contradict what we now know about these planets, but these inaccuracy are largely irrelevent since the themes in many of the stories don't require a science fiction setting. Although it's easy to tell the stories were written fifty years ago, the stories themselves aren't really dated, but it is amusing to read a story where the author didn't put a technology far enough into the future to avoid the popularity",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Disappointing.: I was very disappointed about this book. I find it poorly organized and lacking in content. It basicly consists of very long lists of items, and each item occupying approximately one line, and containing only very little description, and there are very few photos. Everyone who has tried knows that evaluating antiques is very tricky, and even from detailed descriptions and pictures it can be close to impossible. These lists are rather useless unless accompanied by lots of details. Perhaps for very specific items, i.e. china, glass, etc. it could be useful, but I think it has very limited use for furniture.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Excellent Bass: First off I would like to say that this is the only set of headphones that can handle the bass of the music I'm playing. Even expensive home stereo speakers can't handle the amount of bass that I have my EQ set at. The only reason for giving it a 4 star is because they aren't very adjustable. Don't get me wrong because they are comfortable it's just that it doesn't conform perfectly with my one ear. Everyone has slightly different ears from one another. I just wish they could be more adjustable. There are No instructions other than a picture overview on the back of the package. I'm actually afraid to bend the earpiece because I don't know if will bend of just break. Other than that they are great sounding headphones.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Lexy is a spoiled, selfish, egocentric fleabrain, incapable of concern for anyone else--neither her husband nor her unborn child. The husband is fumbling, inept, and downright stupid. I was not affected by his pain, his loss--only by his selfishness. The parts on dog abuse upset and angered me, especially the husband's part in exposing his own dog to the horrors of the underground ""research"" group. The plot is silly, the ending a foregone conclusion from the beginning. Apparently it did not occur to either the professor or his wife to get help for her problems. The novel is somewhat appropriately named--it is a dog and it is babble.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

It isn't that bad of a book, but goes nowhere, instead just mentioning predictions and techno-wiz wonders that could be in the future, but gives no explanation. You can't figure out what half of the things are, until characters use them enough it becomes obvious. There could be a lot of possible continuations of this plot, and it stopped in the middle. This is just the first half of the story! It doesn't even end, just breaks off with the future ahead. I was expecting something to happen, but it didn't. Sure, it explained everything that happened later, but that was all it was, having no plot line at all.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Scarpetta is a complainer: I gave up on Cornwell several books ago, but picked this one up at the library for one more shot. My initial annoyance with the heroine was that she is such a belly-acher: ain't it awful what I have to do, dealing with dead bodies and all. I disliked the token love story with Wesley, who had a perfectly nice wife and family, as being introduced for people who are more interested in sex than in mysteries. Her preoccupation with her niece is obsessive. So I find that this book is worse in all the above. If Kay Scarpetta finds her job so disagreeable, why doesn't she just quit and do something else? I'd like to see a positive attitude here. I am not dazzled by all the techno-garbage. Let's have a heroine I can care about. Scarpetta,",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Good novel about a brutal war: This is one of the better Civil War novels I've read.

The erotic scenes were surprisingly tame or cut short. There was far more philosophy about life, people, and sex than I anticipated.

I love the characters in this book; they are so interesting and different that you'll find yourself really drawn to them. They learn lessons in life and are changed by it, and you can especially see this in reading the later books. Its great! Not many stories do that, and sometimes the ones that do don't do it realistically.The story was really good as well. There was always something to look forward to and you always wanted to know where it would lead.

"Interesting Premise, Clancy's Usual Mediocre Writing: Clancy has gotten the best-selling writer thing down to a formula: a taut, suspenseful plot populated by militaristic all-American heroes and the evil-doers de jour. His merit lies in coming up with gripping, if improbable, settings for his stock characters. On the other hand, his actual writing is mediocre, unimaginative, and devoid of art.Rainbow Six is the conservative Clancy's broadside against the environmental movement. The book's basic (and typically unbelievable) premise is that, in order to save the planet, fanatical environmentalists in charge of a major corporation devise a plot to kill off nearly all of mankind, while the brave men of the elite multinational force to which the title refers s",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Good Stuff: Recorded on two seperate occasions in 1963 and 1965 with replacement drummer Roy Haynes, while Quartet regular Elvin Jones was in rehab, this is a fine addition for any Coltrane collector. Though Jones' trademark thunder is absent, Haynes adds a tight finesse to the typically wild Quartet sound. The material is strong throughout, especially ""Dear Old Stockholm"" and the serene ""After the Rain"". The frenetic ""One Down,One Up"" and ""After the Crescent"" (both recorded during the 1965 session) evoke the kindred mayhem of Coltrane's ""Sun Ship"" recordings made that year and suffer many of the same problems of his work of that period.

But the consecutive times i first clean my skin of all dirt and oils by swiping it with rubbing alcohol and then apply the peel. It works so much better and I dont leave it on past 3 mins cuz the burn is more intense.

When I listen to all the old Priest classics, which are real classic albums, I tend to skip a song or two, especially some of the ballads. No skipping on this my friend and not just because it is new. Halford sounds amazing, even on the stripped down vocal parts - Amazing like 25 years ago.

It would not eject the DVD. I would hear a rattling noise from the motor when I powered on the player, but the tray wouldn't budge. I couldn't pull the tray out, it froze in position.

mean spirited & P. C.: This book was not my first read by Bill Bryson and I will move on to other authors after this read. As I was reading this book I wondered why I had read as much of this author as I have.Bryson tends to look down his nose at people and things that do not meet his obviously cultured standards. His anger whether displayed or passive aggressive has gotten old.An example of my disappointment in this book is the author's report of New York City. Bryson couldn't find anything interesting within the 5 boroughs of the city.His politically correct self contentment is no longer of interest to me.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"A viewer: O.K., I've tried to write this review 4 times and each one sounds more pretentious then the last. Bottom line - this is a good movie. 'Stir of Echoes' sets the mood quickly. In my case, uneasiness and in my wifes case, a sense of dread. The movie depicts an apparently normal blue collar family whose son talks to a dead girl. Dad (Bacon), after being hynotized at a party, starts having strange and horrible visions; he also starts seeing the ghost of the same dead girl in his living room; a ghost that wants something. 'Stir of Echoes' deserves to stand on it's own and not be compared to 'The Sixth Sense.' I personally think 'Stir' is better. If you failed to see this movie because you thought it was a ""Sixth Sense' rip-off, do yourself a BIG favor",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

At one point she talks about wondering if Jesus would want to drink a bottle of gin, and although there are probably a lot of you reading this who think ""So what?"", it really angered me that she claimed to be a follower of Christ but then threw his name around in disregard.

It contains similar rhythmic patterns found on songs like San Jacinto and The Rhythm Of The Heat (from Security) as well as lyrical content along the lines of Washing Of The Water or Come Talk To Me (from Us).Ultimately, Ovo is for Peter Gabriel and world-hybrid music fans.

"This time the stereotypes are a lot closer to the truth: In my experience (and I wish it were not so!), gays tend to share some unpleasant character traits, such as effeminacy or lack of masculinity, cliquishness, and lewdness. The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light. I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art.

The music half very much reminds me of a fusion between Download and the directions on The Process(very expanded).All in all this is a great up-beat(not poppy) album.Buy it if you are tired of mopey tired music.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

One thing that surprised me is that half of the book is about the death of Ted Binion and the whole scandal surrounding it. McManus makes the book too personal at times. It's almost like a journal, and although he might care about his own hourly activities, we don't. We also don't care about his family and his children.

The positive reviews here got me to buy it (although I still didn't expect much). It has quickly become one of my favorite films, one that I'll watch for years. Somehow the two leads manage to convey their characters slow and reluctant growth from a blazing clash of personalities to real intimacy. I believed every word and gesture that they made.

Zeffirelli's daring casting of teenagers Len Whiting and Olivia Hussey in the title roles is perfect in the context of the play of two star-crossed teen lovers. Another ideal casting choice was Michael York as Juliet's cousin, Tybalt. York brings a particular venom to the role, all the while revealing his skill and training as a fencer and former member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. The film is also visually quite beautiful, with outstanding cinematography and scenery.

"Worst of the Clancy Novels: I have read all of Clancy's novels and this is without question the worst. Although not terribly suspenseful, it might have been alright if it had been presented as a short story. Instead it is filled with so much fluff that I found it difficult not to skip through it. At times you feel like Clancy took a European vacation while writing the book and chose to share it with us in fictional form. You're sure to grow tired of Jack's failed attempts to discourage people from calling him 'Sir Jack' or the pretentious pondering that fills these pages. Give this one a pass.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"One of the Best Books I've Read In A Long Time: I loved this novel. It didn't follow the usual plot line of boy meets girl, boy likes girl, boy and girl fight, boy and girl make up and live happily ever after. Flipped follows the relationship patterns of thirteen-year olds more realistically. While the cat-fights didn't exactly match normal eight grade life, the rest was believable. The ending matched the rest of the book perfectly, and I felt like this story was going on right down the street from me. Van Draanen did a wonderful job with her narrations, bringing to light how boys and girls can percieve the exact same conversation differently. This book is wonderful, and if you see it in the bookstore, don't hesitate to pick it up.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
Interesting but Hardly Relevant: Bertrand Russell's thoughts upon religion are often very interesting and exciting to read. I particularly enjoyed reading a theologian's nightmare. However hardly any of this book is philosophy on par with Russell's work in other subjects. Most of what appears to be valid in the book amounts to a critique of Christians. Very little of what Russell says is relevant to contemporary Christian philosophy in that his arguments are outdated. Very interesting but hardly any truth and substance against Christian thought.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

For example, within the space of 288 pages, Dr. Hall manages to expound on everything from aerodynamics and aircraft design (p.162-163) to the basic ideology and driving forces of terrorism (p. 232-233). As a result, ""Nanofuture"" comes off more as the ramblings of an individual rather than a thoroughly researched and objective assessment of nanotechnology.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"The wind was weak: I think James Patterson is a great writer, however, I found this book to be a bit below expectation. Although Patterson found a way to tell this story of genetic alteration and a possible governemet cover-up, the story itself was a bit too far fetched. I did find that his research made the story more believiable, however, all the medical research books in the world could not have made me want to continue reading this story. I did finish it and while I was disappointed with the conclusion, it was understandable to me why he ended it the way he did. To sum up may feelings for the book, I am going to have to give it a thumbs down and not encourage a Patterson groupie like myself to read it.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Shocking Eye Opener of the British SAS: A very interesting book that reveals shocking facts about the Bravo two Zero mission of the SAS. The author has carefully researched his finding and they make logical sense. It also puts to shame Andy Mc Nab and Chris Ryan (members of the mission) who wrote books about their self acclaimed bravery during the mission. I dont think that the author has gone through the trouble and the research to down play the SAS or the shameful recruits (Andy & Chris) but has done a commendable job in redeeming respect for late Sgt Vince Phillips (another member of the mission) who's name was disgraced by Andy & Chris in their books.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

First time I watched the movie, I laughed out loud during this scene and it scared my dog who was sleeping on my lap at the time.

Unfortunately, the book does not include a legend or other explanatory notes on how to translate time. Each chapter is titled ""Century I,"" ""Century II,"" etc. The best I could guess is that Century I is perhaps the 16th Century, based on the date of Nostradamus' Forward to his son (1555).

Moby Dick or the white whale: I have been going back and reading some of the classics that I should have read while in school. IMO this is one of the worst written.

Most of the book just over describes almost every type of fish in the ocean. One of the most boring books read or written. Glad I was smart enough to skip this one in school.

Utter crap!!: I had to read this book for a class dealing with other cultures and I hated reading every single page. I don't see how this book relates in any realistic way to the class I took.

"Biography? History? Memory Improvement?: Jonathan D. Spence has written a book which can fall into a number of categories. On one level, it is a biography of a Jesuit who worked as a missionary in China during the Post-Reformation period. On another, it is an examination of his remarkable memory. On yet another, it vividly describes the China of this era and the efforts to bring Christianity to this closed society. The structure of the book is unusual for the genre, but is surprisingly successful. Ultimately, the book becomes a sort of psycho-historical account of a most remarkable man in a most remarkable place in a most remarkable time.

He's just escaped from the wizard prison, Azkaban, and everyone thinks he wants to kill Harry. It's very mysterious and once you start reading it, you can't stop.

"Excellent Content - HORRIBLE PRINTING: This review focuses not on the content or ideas as written by Einstein (which are excellent) but instead on the printing by Ancient Wisdom Publications (ISBN 978-1-936690-01-5).This book feels like it was scanned, given a basic once-over for any huge mistakes, and then sent out to print. It suffers from numerous spelling and typographical errors, but more importantly, the equations and diagrams are atrocious! I believe they scanned all tables, equations, and images, and then enlarged them. The images are all blurry and poorly printed. Some of the equations are unreadable because the parenthesis or square root signs are so blurred.Unfortunately (as other reviewers have pointed out), Amazon lumps all reviews for a work",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Slightly disappointed: This product had two redeeming features: 1. It was less than $10.00 2. Free shipping.I got what I paid for. It was impossible to assemble because the parts did not fit each other. I had to drill holes for attaching the handles properly. The parts, once all in place, did not fit each other, so that one rack was level, the other tilted....it made it difficult to grill hot dogs without them rolling off. In short, it was poorly manufactured, but I used it until it burnt a hole through the planking on the deck--and then I set it out for the scrap metal scavengers.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging.

Rose McGowan was wonderful for this part. She was innocent, sexy, loving, but in a way lethal. I would recommend this movie. This movie isn't really a horror film more of a thrilling one. The school parts are great, but when Rose get's pushed to far with her strict grandmother things start to get tough. Rose McGowan would be a perfect teenager, but just for one thing is how people just use her. You see her emotions during the ending of the film which are surprising and quite sad, but it worked out well.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that I think the book could have gone a bit deeper into each presidency without adding too much length.

"Whining in Richmond: Okay. I read books while riding an exercise bike in the morning before I go to work. If it is a good read, I'll pick up where I left off reading when I return home. In the past, Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series has often been that type of book. But . . . not this time. The padding (and lack of a courageous editor) is obvious. Kay's repeated musings about ""poor me"" and inward entreaties became tiresome within the first 50 pages, yet the pattern continued to repeat throughout. The whining about personal relationships got so bad that I thought I was reading Elizabeth George! Also, every short trip, whether by car, SUV or helicopter in and about the Richmond vicinity could not pass without detailed, trivial, irrelevant descriptions of cars,",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I would not recommend these antennas to anyone. I didn't believe the reviews myself but found them to be true. I felt maybe some people were interpreting these antennas to increase the range and thus were giving poor reviews for that reason.

The sheer genius of this song, and their debut album, cannot possibly be listed by me in this short space. The Boyz, as I like to call them, use a white t-shirt as a metaphor for unity among different groups of people. Thus, lyrics like ""Hispanic cracka n**** even yangs wearin white tee"" show exactly the peaceful, loving force that the Boyz are trying to spread throughout the world.

He shows various steps with a gun and a factory cutaway (a helpful thing), but occasionally does not position the gun so you can see the parts he is talking about.

"So Maybe I'm A Sucker For The Modern...: Perhaps the old classics aren't for me. The archaic language was difficult to follow in places, and there wasn't much actual story. Irving very much liked to go off on tangents, describing things in detail when it wasn't needed (not to say the descriptions were poorly done, simply that they shouldn't have been there). To put the actual story on paper, it would probably fill half a page.That being said, it's nice to sometimes read older works- it's a way to 'cleanse the palette', as it were.As for the actual Kindle edition- there were a number of glitches in the type (letters replaced by random symbols). Perhaps someone should take another look at editing this.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Her incorporation of the personal stories of victims of the Pol Pot regime's Tuol Sleng extermination center helps readers better understand the atmosphere of those terrible days.

"You can skip this one: This film had potential, but the storyline collapses and really leaves the audience disappointed. First, let me start with the background music. Music plays an important role in a film. The quirky instrumental that continually played throughout the film set a bad tone. I wasn't sure if I was supposed to be watching a thriller or a comedy. Turns out I was watching neither. The film lacked any sort of thrills or edge of the seat terror. The drama was at a minimum, and the few comedic moments fall flat. If you're watching this for Hayden, you'll be disappointed. She doesn't have alot of dialogue. If its Tim Daly you want, well, his character is a total bore. Overall, the reveal at the end is a let down. The film is only 77 minutes long,",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

This album features the amazing vocals of Toby Hitchcock, a 20 something tenor. His voice is very reminiscent of Tony Lewis from The Outfield, but with a much smoother delivery. This album features some of the best vocal harmony I have heard in a long time as well as the rocking band to back it up. Dont pass this one up.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Doesn't feel like home: I was very dissappointed in this much anticipated release. Each piece on ""Come Away With Me"" was distinct and memorable and could stand on its own merit. On this CD, the selections blend together, in a not very appealing way. I found myself getting bored and skipping to the next track to see if there was a pleasant surprise waiting. Usually, there was not. The tone of the CD was rather downbeat. ""Sunrise"" is nice, but even though I'm a Dolly Parton fan, I did not like the duet ""Creepin' In"". There was just too much sameness on this CD, and nothing seized my attention or emotions. Also missing was much of Norah's distinctive piano playing. My recommendation is to stay with the first CD and wait for the third.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

For the rest of the movie, the villain's hit man tries to kill the girl. Not only can this ten year old manage to constantly foil a ""professional,"" but this hit man must have failed Hit Man School.

The unit was never abused, never dropped, loaded 4 playlist changes via MusicMatch without incident and then on a sunny day in Austin decided to die.

The movie just jumps from one scene to the next, with no rhyme or reason. It is missing alot of filler that is needed to flesh out the script.3) I actually felt jipped when leaving the movie, don't think I have ever felt that way(there are bad movies, but this set a new standard).I'm really, really hoping that there is a Director's Cut.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Hence the price.What's really odd is that they throw in ONE of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock films into the mix...what's he got to do with any of this? Was it done to mislead buyers so Basil's face can appear on the cover instead of Ronald Howard's? Makes no sense, the set contains 39 of R.

Next thing my husband and I knew - my son (8) was flying around the store with her, and she was holding on and laughing so hard she had tears in her eyes! When it was time to go she cried all the way home untill we put her back in it!! She would have slept in it it we would have let her. Now she's 10 months - and still loves it the same!

Because I was over 200 pages into it, I decided to keep reading. It was a slow read. The portions of the book that related to the Irish Potato Famine were enthralling. However, I found the protagonist to be poorly drawn and her behavior inexplicable--the text never really delved into what made her tick. In the end I came away with the feeling that this book could have used a good editor who would have helped the author decide on her focus and then edit the text down to its appropriate length.

"1869 French-Prussian War bore!: In FIELD OF HONOR you might gain a little insight into the French-Prussian War and the lottery-draft selection that France had in place in 1869,but little else can be gained from watching this dreadfully acted and tedious 1988 film directed by Jean-Pierre Denis.It is very much an 1980's French arthouse film chock full of symbolism framed by a truly bizarre soundtrack that seems to be characteristic of this genre.The story is extremely static and the characters fit the bill.It IS beautifully filmed, though, and for that I can at least give it two stars,but not a farthing more!THE RETURE OF MARTIN GUERRE IS FAR SUPERIOR FILM.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing.

The acting was very amateur (that's an insult to amateurs actually, I've seen some home movies that are better than this); The directing is almost nonexistent: two characters are often scrunched together (on a couch or standing) so closely so they fit in the frame-- looks very unnatural.

"Don't waste your money - Buy Alpha Centauri: This game is a VERY VERY poor follow on in the Civilization genre. All they did was make the game more turns (and therefore more tech adv). They added a number of sub rosa attacks. User Interface was tough to get used to for moving units. (I often ended up clicking a unit into a long move series...) Finally, the end game graphics stunk...In fairness, their trade model is better, as well as the tile improvements model (no more enigneers/settlers). They kept capitalization and infrastructure (from Civ II). Very good is the ability to save a production queue to use later.Go to the Alpha Centauri page now and buy that instead.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

She has woven a large ensemble cast of characters for her story of adventure, friendship, and romance. Apart from the villain who drives the story, most of the characters change and mature as the result of their experiences.There is a very untypical English equalitarian disregard of class and appearances which, while it suits the storyline, required me to suspend my disbelief in order to fully appreciate the many qualities of this ensemble story. My other difficulty was that in addition to there being a large number of characters to keep up with, some characters were referred to by multiple names.

However, I will be honest in saying that the screen went fuzzy a few times for about 15 seconds and then returned to normal, which I wasn't expecting. Also, if you are excited to see the movie because you thought the book was great, don't bother seeing it, because it was terrible. East of Eden is one of those books that no movie could ever justify.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Director William Malone throws away such things as character development and sensible storytelling to go for pure visceral thrills and shocks; something that worked in his 1999 remake of House on Haunted Hill, but it doesn't work it all here. The talents of Stephen Dorff and Natasha McElhone are wasted here as neither's character is allowed to develop, thus both actors give lacking performances. The story revolves around an internet site visited by four people, all of which died 48 hours after visiting the site. The screenplay is loaded with plot holes and contrievances, hardly explaining anything of the going's on.

"Misleading text: This text explores human nature in a completely dry, systematic, and cliched manner. It conveys none of the realities of human experience. It describes the customs and practices followed by only a handful of societies in the world, and it does so in a distorted and often sensationalized manner. For example, it portrays Christianity as a simple religion of snake handlers, and it describes the Christian practice of eating the body of God in the COMMUNION WATER! The text communicates that there is no meaning or reason to human existence, and it picks apart each aspect of humanity until there is nothing left but the absurdity of all human thought and belief.

Wrap the key up in bubble wrap or something so it doesn't feel like a key, then put a few layers of duct tape over that, and put a misleading label on it like ""spare fuses"" or ""mini first aid kit"". Then put it somewhere out of the way in the car, like behind the tailight access covers in the trunk.

Her anecdotal recounting of how diet cured her of MS completely ignores scientific fact that some cases of MS go into remission. Others have a single episode and return to health. But including this info wouldn't sell books, would it? She offers 100 pages with some rather absurd theories, e.g., electric blankets are bad for you, then launches into recipes only!

Still, much of the story is entertaining, and if you are able to get past the idea of a story told from inside the mind of a stray dog you may very well enjoy this book.

"difficult to depict passion: Having been blown away by the book, I was receptive to several friends' recommendation to view the film. With an all-star cast directed by Louis Malle, how bad could it be? Pretty terrible. Perhaps it's not possible to visually portray the dark urges explored so vividly in the novel. Not to disparage the performances, but I didn't understand who the characters were in relation to themselves, much less to one another. Competently crafted with excellent sets and costumes, the film was sometimes almost laughable in its determined attempt to capture the ineffable. BTW, I watched the unrated version and the interview with Louis Malle.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Boring and Outdated: Ok at the beginning of 112's career as in many other groups, they went through that stage where their trying to find themselves in the music. 112 found themeselves between Room 112 and Part III.

I love 112's music and support them 100% but this is their downfall. I wouldn't waste time on this one. I give it 2 stars just because of about 3 songs and effort.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Scum like this is also why the NCAA wants Congress to ban betting on college sports, which will be a shame for those of us who aren't scum and who just want to enjoy betting on college hoops or pigskins every now and then.

Once I saw on the bottom of the screen that he had an album out, I knew I had to get it. His voice is so unique that its insane.

"A classic splatter film.: Though admittedly lax in the logic department, this film by Italian horror maestro Dario Argento is still a stylishly ghoulish treat. The bizarre sets and brilliant, almost lurid, color schemes(utilizing Technicolor's ""Matrix"" system)combine to create a strange netherworld of supernatural menace and imminent doom. Immensely adding to the viewer's unease is the booming score by Goblin. A diabolical concoction consisting of many different styles, the music acts as the final catalyst in the audience's free-fall into unimaginable terror. Intensely savage, flamboyantly artistic and unforgettably terrifying, Suspiria is definately a classic splatter film.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

There are no confirmed cases, anywhere in the world, of bigfoot exhibiting violence toward humans, let alone abducting and/or sexually abusing them.

And the usually wonderful George Sanders played one of his patented quick-talking smarmy characters but without any of the wit, charm or menace he showed in so many of his performances, including All About Eve and Rebecca.

"Fantastic item- highly recommend it for reflux babies!!: I saw this item on a relative's registry and decided to buy one when I was getting ready for our second child. I thought it would be a good way for our three year old to ""admire"" the new baby without having to hold him all the time. It works great for that- but even better for keeping our baby asleep! He is a spitter, and has recently been diagnosed with reflux at just three weeks. A recommendation for reflux babies is to allow them to be at an incline after feedings. This serves that purpose perfectly. It keeps the baby warm and snuggly and helps to stop the spitting up! Only word of warning- make sure the baby is centered in the cushion if sleeping. Our son managed to wriggle over the side a bit.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"All-time great: I always forget what a masterpiece of cinema David Lean's Brief Encounter is, but am instantly reminded when I sit down again to be mesmerized by its spell.This may be a screen adaptation of stage material, but creaky and theatrical this is certainly not. On the contrary, Noel Coward's drama is transformed into something uniquely cinematic. The story concerns the bittersweet affair of central character Laura Jesson (Johnson) with Dr Alec Harvey (Howard), and it is a story that is told intriguingly through Robert Krasker's inspired lighting and camerawork, Jack Harris's editing and Sergei Rachmaninov's music, taken from the Second Piano Concerto, but which nevertheless could have been written for the film.

Though it wasn't a narrative non-fiction, it was filled with stories that accented the numbers and the big picture Kolata created about epidemic flu. Though I wasn't so interested in the history of disease and death chapter, most of the other ones were good. I found the human trials interesting.

A more appropriate epistemological foundation would be ""Thonnard, F.-J., Pr??cis de philosophie, Paris, Descl??e, 1950"" (sorry, out of print, but I want to translate it and put it on my website, God willing).For",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Perfect Book for a Senior Girl: The second book in the series, this novel caught my attention from the first diary entry. I immediately related to Jessica Darling, and felt her pain. She shares her feelings on the difficult decisions a senior girl has to make. Her trials and tribulations about boys, school, sleep, drama, and colleges makes the reader feel very lucky they are not dealing with her high school. The problems Jessica has with her parents, older sister, and her best friend that moved away gives every reader something to relate to. I could not put this book down because you, the reader, becomes part of the book. I wanted to help Jessica, and I wanted her to hook up with Marcus, as though I was Jessica Darling.

Every time you turn it on, you have to pump a button to bring the volume up to the max which is only medium in my opinion. It only maintains the type of sound, not the volume. You also have to be carfeul turning it on to not push it all the way to the timed setting. This will turn it off after a period of time. The first setting on the on/off switch will leave it on until you turn it off, but my sons cannot turn it on carefully enough to avoid that second timed setting.

"No better than Stephen King: While cultural pundits try to convince you that some literature is better than other literature, the truth is that all art is relative to individial tastes. Thus, it doesn't make any sense to think that a novel like this one is really any better than say, Michael Crichton or Stephen King. Aesthetic standards can't be grounded.Thus, don't listen to anyone who tries to distinguish between ""serious"" works of literature like this one and allegedly ""lesser"" novels. The distinction is entirely illusory, because no novels are ""better"" than any others, and the concept of a ""great novel"" is an intellectual hoax.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

I only bought it because my wife acted in it, and we needed it for her demo reel.I'm sorry, there is not one redeeming thing about this movie: not the story, certainly not the directing and editing, and the acting is slow and boring.In case you really want to know, it's about a woman who gets involved with a guy who seduces and kills unsuspecting victims, and films the whole thing. Of course the ghosts of these women are some of the characters of the movie.Beware of the director who writes his own script. There will be nobody around to stop him.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Mos Def is an artist and this is his artistic outbreak. He is telling the world that hip hop needs to move, not just forward, but outward, into real music, into creative impossibility, into art. The day of the B-boy is over and Mos Def is one of the most daring moving us into a whole new era. Creative and thought-provoking. This is only the beginning.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"I think Ted Hawkins is wonderful but....: If you're only going to buy one Ted Hawkins CD make sure it's not this one. (Go for ""Songs From Venice Beach"" or the ""Next Hundred Years."")This CD is mainly the ""filler"" that was cut when the original Venice Beach tapes was reduced from 2 LPs to one CD (Songs From Venice Beach.) The result is that Songs From Venice Beach has most of the best material. However, this CD does have Ted Hawkins singing ""Dock of the Bay"" and ""Chain Gang"" without which no Ted Hawkins collection is complete.So if you're a Ted Hawkins fan you do need to buy this CD, just don't buy it first.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"junk! (Save the mosic): When I was little, I heard the classic tune ""O fortuna"" for the first time as a sound track of this movie. Finally, yesterday, I had a chance to watch the movie itself. I started with great expectation only to be deeply disappointed. Not consistent, no climax, no character development...just storytelling. Battle scene was disappointing too. Generallly just handful of soilders fight. Even I saw one of a sword simple bent (but the knight 'stabbed' by the bent sword was killed!). Duel scenes look ridiculous. Nudity made me doubt the whole movie. IMHO, it seems to be a cheesy one. Just very long movie without any fun or merit. One star is due to Patrick Stewart of Startrek fame.

"The Worst Kids' Magazine Ever Created: Once I found myself among a group of parents who were talking about this magazine. One person said that it was the worst magazine he could possibly imagine. Another said that she put it in an envelope and paid to send it back with an angry letter. I thought, ""What could possibly be so bad?"" Then we received a subscription as a gift. As other reviewers have noted, the entire magazine is advertisements for things like junk food. The ""articles"" in the one I looked at were also like advertisements, being articles about the newest Disney movie or the science of video games. It was terrible.

There are two ok songs but all sound the same and they would make great elevator music. The tempo is so slow and I think I heard one up tempo part of a song. This is a classic case of the record label or awards show trying to build an artist. It would have been fine for her to win a couple of awards but not the volume she did.

"Story has been done to death!: I was very disappointed with the book for many reasons. First, the story is cliche and has been done to death - black cat, haunted house, witches and magic. Secondly, I didn't feel that the characters were believable. An example is the Marty Sullivan character, a loser and a drunkard with an attitude - the guy you love to hate. His wife is very religious and very proper. Towards the end of the book there are a couple of times where she yells at him and he shrinks like a raisin and takes it from her. This is just not believable in a character like Marty Sullivan. The end was surprising and very abrupt - but also not believable.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Good compact but a little slow: I own a cybershot 4.0 and had been waiting to purchase a smaller, more compact Sony camera, but wanted it to be approx. twice the resolution, so decided to buy the DSCT-10, in hopes it would be smaller camera, with bigger screen and faster at getting those quick pics, as many of the newer cameras are now. Well, 2 out of 3 ain't bad. The resolution in prints is excellent, the screen is large and quite nice and with the shake resistant circuitry I don't miss the viewfinder, as I thought I might.

The imagery and creative thought provoking lyrics were incredible as well as the new sound that they were played in. Things were going great for Matchbox Twenty untill they decided to change their style and go with more of a pop sound. This is where they released their sell-out album Mad Season.

"Apporved By THIS Teen: As a rather picky reader who goes through an average of 66 books a month, I am particularly choosy with my fantasy and sci-fi books. Only a precious few authors ever write a book that is to my liking.For instance, I have never liked any of Philip Pullman's books. I always try and read them when a new one comes out, but they don't keep my intrest.However, with this book, Jones was able to keep me glued to the page throught the whole story. Upon finishing, I immediatly returned to the libraey to get the sequel, Year of the Griffon.All in all, the whole thing is thrilling, fun, and rather charming, with the griffon children and Blade screaming in people's faces and canivourus sheep.I love the sheep.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

When it says ""You . . . [think or do something grossly out of character for the reader] it creates (in this reader, at least) a distracting cognitive dissonance.The blurb on the front cover calls the book ""blindingly funny,"" a great overstatement.

With the powerwind hose reel, all you do is step on the lever, & it winds it up for you. I use my hose quite frequently, & it definately helps out my back from having to bend & crank.

I didn't really know what to expect, but the book has some very interesting aspects on life and ways to live, that still work extremely well in todays society. I have at many times found myself in situations described in the book and even though some answers might be a bit hard to understand, the book has given me answers, or perhaps ways to answer/respond, in different situations. It's not really a book you read from cover to cover, but pick up and read a couple of ""rules"" every now and then, which after a while are in the back of your head, ready for use.I highly reccommend this book to pretty much every one.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

If other readers felt disgusted of the cocaine-stuffed dead baby, it only showed the writer's vivid paintbrush in writing. The first part is just like a fast-delivered introduction of several main characters who were just born cops but forced into retirement yet still die-hard(just like the movie, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, each of the seven roles got some specialties to get the job done).

Stross shovels on an unbelievable amount of jargon from page one, and that's all there really ever is.

You never get the sense that they're anything more than jargon mouthpieces - with the one exception, they largely march through the plot, never really taking in, reacting to, or feeling anything.

It is a genuinely catchy song.Unfortunately I can not say the same for the rest of the CD.

"Only My Personal Bias: What a yawn fest. A non-fiction book that reads like a work of fiction? Sorry to bring down the rating but personally, I hate most fiction, and this writing style turned me off. The author pretty much lays out the entire story in the first few chapters, and then I feel like I'm reading L. Ron Hubbard with setting and narration by John Steinbeck.Though if this is what you're looking for buy the book! I haven't heard a book more highly recommended about Edgar Cayce than ""The story of Edgar Cayce: There is a river.""It just wasn't for me.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The character development consisted of little more than their name and call sign. The characters all tend to be petty, and self centered with little variation. The 'no one is better than me' attitude was tiring in the beginning, and the trend stayed through the entire book. It was very much like a soap opera.On a good note, the action scenes were enjoyable, but I found myself not really caring what happenes to the characters in the end.

I've heard eight or ten different live versions of some of Monk's classic tunes -- Blue Monk, `Round Midnight, Misterioso, Straight, No Chaser -- each rendition different. Some were hit out of the ballpark, while others left men on base.

You can't believe 1/2 of what they print. 2) It doesn't focus on the clubhouse/players, as someone pointed out, but that's not the goal.It's a review of what got the Sox to the '04 title. At the same time, it shows the greed of the Sox owners and the stubborness of Lucchino that made them fall down in '05 and now '06, and I fear will probably prevent them from getting another title soon.

Aside from that, the strap kept riding up into her eyes. It seems that your dog must have a blocky head (e.g., Boxer) in order for that not to happen, but my dog does not. I returned the Gentle Leader, went web-surfing and found something made in Scotland called the Canny Collar. No risk of neck injury, no strap in the eyes and, yes, no pulling!

Nothing that Earl does is worth listening to if you're looking at the lyrics. He uses every rap cliche in the book, so I just can't feel any of his songs. On this album, he comes with rhymes my 8 year old brother could top, and he don't even like rap yet! For all the people claiming that DMX has the best album ever, did you actually listen to the lyrics on this album? They're horrible!

The total professionalism that Jeff showed by withdrawing from the series is soo very understandable!! The series would have become a cult classic if it had ended after the third season!! No one remembers the series that faded out... this show deserved soooo much better than to become a cheap copy(!) of the UNWATCHABLE US series 'friends'.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"What music and singing were meant to be...: It would be hard to further embellish on what John Jones (customer review August 28, 1998) said about this incredible album. Regardless of your normal musical tastes, you will find something on this album to relish (and mostly likely, the whole album). Holly Cole is a powerful and musical singer. Her vocals are crisp, clean, and precise. Cole has a wonderful voice: soulful at times, popish at others, but always sexy and seductive. She sings with a tremendous dynamic range, a refreshing change from the so often over amplified and ""processed"" singers of today. Cole demonstrates her versatility on this album with a variety of sounds from the soulful ballads, to the pop sound jazz renditions. If you like music, you w",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

To do this is a true revelation, as the cookie and the caramel mingling sinfully with the chocolate is like dying and going to heaven.

Not disappointed in the least, I was overjoyed to see that this one was almost as good. As far as horror remakes go, it's an absolute winner. While not possessing quite the same feeling of shut-in violence the original had, there is still plenty to enjoy. The story has been beefed up some(there is a baby involved, there are female members of ""The Family"")and it is undoubtedly more violent(unnecessarily), but in many ways retains the same feeling of being trapped in one of the most frightening places on earth.

"Wheels not in plane: Delta tools have really gone down hill. I've had this saw for over a year now and while it is adequately powered, the drive wheels are not in plane. In other words, the blade does not run in the center of the upper wheel when it is centered on the lower drive wheel. Instead, it runs on the front. This causes the blade to come off the wheel alot and that destroys blades. There is not enough adjustment on the alignment mechanism to get it to even run on the center of the top wheel because it binds against the cover. This seems to be a common problem with this saw, as other reviews mention it. It's like there is a washer/space missing. Wish I had my old 16"" Delta back that was 20+ years old.

Thanks to Marrin, I now understand the difference.With so little known about Captain Morgan before he made a name for himself as a buccaneer, I believe Marrin does an excellent job in setting the scene by describing the world Morgan lived in. Without going over-the-top, he adequately describes the political and social scene of the day however fair or unjust it may have been. He also gives a good impression of the many injustices that were accepted as part of everyday life that are very difficult for us to comprehend today (e.g., slavery, torture, terrorism, etc.).After reading this book, I understand why Morgan",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

(I firmly believe she hangs out with Elizabeth Peters; Joan Hess occasionally dropping in to make a threesome..)Enough fawning! Read this book! It's interesting! You can tell them I said so...",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
"Enjoyable, but really really stupid: Ok so the premise for the book is a good one, one star earned there. But the execution is retarded. For one, HH has the United States progress through four years of industrialization in a matter of months, completely ignoring the obvious impossibilities of such a rapid change in 1861. Second, how the hell could three/four corps conquer America and reincorperate the Americans back into the British empire, the limeys were not stupid as they are in this book. Basically the book completely devolves into a series of mindless drivel, entertaining drivel, one star.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

The dialouge sucked, real people do not talk like that(someone here gave a great example of what I'm talking about).

I finally started reading this series whenever I heard about the movie.(which is great by the way) Wacky humor, strange decriptions of the ordinary, and super intelligent mice. Don't ask. Don't panic, and whatever you do Read this book.Trying to describe the plot is pointless, for one it makes no sense, and it's not why you read a Adam's novel. I won't give away any jokes, or the such, but if you like Monty Python, or better yet have the smallest hint of a since off humor, read this series.

I'm not thrilled with the 30 sec timer (it stutters), but perhaps it's forcing me to brush longer. The sonic action really seems to get the toothpaste into all the nooks and crannies, but also (unfortunately) onto my shirt. You really have to make a conscious effort to keep your mouth closed, and even then toothpaste will inevitably leak out. I think the sonic action liquefies the paste much more than manual brushing.

The LoL:GoD graphics were better, and that's sad, since it came out years earlier, and they were worse than the ones in the first game! Also, I don't think the game setup is all that fun; the guild idea would be cooler if you couldn't join every one.

Lazarus Long is a loveable scoundrel with a heart of gold, and you fall in love with the other members of his family.

"Like being onboard Starship Enterprise *when it works*: This incredible gadget has so many features it makes you feel like you're a member of the Enterprise crew. It also has enough menus and screens to leave even hardcore electronic gadget junkie satisfied. Yet, it has one shortcoming - it doesn't work half the time under real life conditions. Perhaps if you are in an open desert or a similar terrain it is reliable, but even with light tree cover (20-25%) or hills nearby it sadly reports ""weak signal"" and cannot calculate your position. To me, all the other features are an icing on the cake, but without being able to fulfill its primary mission, it becomes but an expensive electronic paperweight.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

While it theoretically has quite a few nice features, the still (jpeg) picture quality is very poor (fuzzy) and and video would not play properly at all - it was broken up, despite my using Edge's own branded media. After reading the instructions and online FAQ, to no avail, I quickly decided to return it and look for a better quality, (ie probably more expensive) unit. More trouble than it was worth, especially in terms of my time in troubleshooting.

However is has some points that show that the show, mainly in its first season was a groundbreaker and visionary one.

I was using a Linksys USB wifi adapter, but ever since I've had it I've had my connection fail, sometimes as often as every 10 minutes or so. I decided to try something new, and since this had the highest score of the ones at the store, I gave it a go.It wasn't worth it. After installing the software, and plugging in the adapter, the software program told me I was connected, but Windows said it had no connectivity. Tried repairing the connection, restarting, uninstalling and reinstalling. Same issue.

"300 Spartans . . . and hardly one will be missed: Given the quality of the main cast, the number of extras engaged, and the storyline, it's hard to see how this film could fail in its purpose. But like the real 300, it does. At first glance it has the look of an expensive epic. Yet, despite the presence of Richard Egan and Sir Ralph Richardson and an assortment of usually proficient actors, it's a lacklustre enterprise, ranging from the wooden to the excessively theatrical, an unintentional parody of history. In a film this bad, being bumped off early on must have been a relief. The theme music redeems the effort in part, for one star.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

In each song, not only are the lyrics repetitive, but the music consists of phrases that are intoned again and again, without much variation.

Pages are coming loose from the binding. The text is not justified and is ragged on the Right Side of the pages. This is a minor point to some, but I find it very distracting. I just think for the price, a book should not be falling apart and the text should be properly formatted. The quality of this volume is as if they printed it at home, using substandard word processing software, and glued it together using discounted paste.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Once I powered up the computer, and brought up some music files, WOW, these speakers are awesome!!!

"one of Monk's best: On Brilliant Corners, the music was as challenging as anything he had done in the past, but now the public seemed to be ready for what he was doing. Many consider this the album to be a masterpiece, and rightly so. Max Roach's drumming on the title track sounds great--tight, and full of impact. ""Pannonica"" made its debut on this album, and features Monk on both piano and celeste at the same time. Originally recorded on the spur of the moment to fill space on the album, the tender ""I Surrender, Dear"" sounds like you're right there in the studio. ""Bemsha Swing"" is a bit sloppy, but Roach's tympani playing stands out much more than it did on the OJC version. The only problem I noticed here is a click at the beginning of the title track.

"Great for Novices: This book is a wonderful introduction to the zine world for those who have little or no knowledge of desktop publishing or graphic arts. It was instrumental to me in the launching of my own zine, Beyond Bizarre.

Classic Underrated Gem: This is an absolute gem of an album that went largely un-noticed on release in 1988. I won my copy (tape) on a radio call in - only thing I ever won. If it had been released a couple of years earlier (circa Dire Straits Brothers in Arms or Chris Rea - Dancing with Strangers) I can't believe that it would not have been huge. North and South is the absolute standout - I could listen to it forever absolutely sensational slow builder. Shipyard Town was the first single - nearly as catchy as Baker Street - and a similar style. Moonlight and Gold was the second single - a smoother than smooth ballad and stunner.

"1979 Period Piece: Definitely a period piece, it is worth a revisit 31 years later for several reasons. First, it gave Meryl Streep her first Oscar (as a ""Supporting"" Actress, so don't expect to see a lot of her). Second, it's an interesting look at what socially was probably ground-breaking gender-bending in 1979: the question of whether the best ""mom"" for a child caught in divorce could be the dad. And third, the young son caught between his parents is simply adorable!What I like about this film is its realism. Neither parent is portrayed as the bad person, and the emotional development of each character is believable.

Remington Powder Actuated Tool 476: I bought this tool a few years back and I could never get it to fire. When I needed it and it wouldn't fire I went another way with the project. I owned one earlier and it worked great until it disappeared. The new one doesn't appear to have a firing pin. The plate that strikes the cartridges is slightly concave without any protruding parts. I just went online to determine if a safety feature requires me to unscrew the top bolt to access and remove the concave plate so it would work. No such directions. Oops....Remington must have forgotten the firing pin. The Remington quality is suffering.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"You can scan slides with out unmounting them: With the film scanner attachment door closed and turned upside down you will find 3 pairs of rubber tabs (I am assumming all LiDE 600Fs are the same as mine). These Rubber tabs allow you to hold 3 mounted slides in place while you turn the film scanner attachment over and place it on the scanning bed. From here scan as you would for film. Not the best for someone who has a lot of slides to scan in a hurry, thus I rate the scanner as a 4 instead of a 5Sorry made a mistake. The software is too smart. It looks for the gaps between frames to seperate files, and the mounts muck this up. Clearly the hardware designers and the programs had a laps in communication.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Buyer Beware: I was excited to receive Hope in a Jar for Christmas but after a few uses developed a horrible, raised, itchy red rash all over my face and developed very sensitive dry skin. Thinking that perhaps daily use was too much at first I decided to try it again - the rash started developing about 8 hours later and got worse even after washing my face with a gentle cleanser. Took about 5 days before my skin was back to normal.I've never had this type of reaction to a product before and will stick to Philosophy scents as opposed to skin products.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"No so crazy about ""Like Crazy"": I usually like movies that are different from the usual, text book love story, but this one wasn't my favorite. It was slow paced at times, the dialogue could have been a lot stronger especially between the two main characters. Their acting was fine, but there was definitely an element missing in this movie. If you're looking for a classic love story, then keep looking.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Maybe hard to find but keep trying.. it is worth it.Her Characters you will not forget and find yourself thinking about them when you are not reading! Her World Fantasy Awards reflect this unique author's ability to move the reader to an unusual time.She is the kind of author you really ""hate"" (as you read one more page at 3:00am) and must get up at 7:00am!One does not find this ability in authors very often.. don't miss the chance!",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"A Lesbian-Like Romance: Ann and Lucy were infatuated with each other. As graduate students at the University of Iowa, they lived together in an intense,passionate relationship. True, they both saw men, but what is the reader to make of Lucy crawling into bed with Ann, leaping into her arms, sitting on her lap, and(endlessly) asking her if she ""loves her best."" Is this a platonic friendship?Although the L word doesn't pop up in this book,I think it's reasonable queston to ask----and a reasonable question for any reader of this memoir. what exactly was the nature of their relationship? Why did Lucy never marry? Why did Ann end her marriage after a few years of trying it out? Why did they never quite lose their sense of intimacy?Ann doesn't answer many of the",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Didn't receive the product I was viewing: There are two photos here. One, with the authentic head band and the other, comparing the bootleg version with the authentic one. Here's the problem... I was hoping to receive the authentic one but turned out to get the bootlegged one. I'm not very happy with it but I'm not planning to use it for cosplay or something of that nature. Still would've been better to get the better looking one.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
Promising: The Arcade Fire is a very promising act. To they sound like if you mix very old Talking Heads with classic british Wave band Sad Lovers And Giants. Then you add a little canadian flavour from the likes of Stellastarr or even the Spoons as well as some more poppy elements. Then shake it all well and enjoy. That's the best Funeral you can get. Believe it or not! I especially recommend track no. 9 or 1.,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

"Excellent: When I heard that my wife was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and I wanted to know all about it, my first thought was if there was a ""for Dummies"" book on it. Sure enought, there is. My second thought was if it would be up to the excellent standards of most of the other ""for Dummies"" books. It was. This book has a lot. My wife had to go to a four-day program to be informed about diabetes and how to live with it. This book contains a surprising amount of the same material. It got me up to speed at almost the rate she was. Impressive. If you want to know about diabetes, get this book.",REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE

Doesn't work for long: I purchased this model in March 2002 and in May 2003 - it just quit working! I thought the battery had run out - recharged it -nothing! Bought a new battery - still nothing. All it'll do now is make a click noise when you switch to camera or vcr. Cant even get my tape out of the damn thing now! Call Panasonic - what a joke! They wanted $149.00 for a diagnostic test and $102.00 service charge - I only paid about $300 for it new. I'll never buy another panasonic again - the service was terrible and they are not helpful AT ALL! Good luck if you buy one - get the extended warranty! They should sell them for $50.00 and just make them disposable!,REVIEW,NOT APPLICABLE
